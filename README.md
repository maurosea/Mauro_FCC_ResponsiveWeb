# Mauro_FCC_ResponsiveWeb
Hi! My name's Mauro, and I just have finished completing Responsive Web Design courses by freeCodeCamp. Basicallty, I have zero experience about coding and programming, so, being able to complete the courses from freeCodeCamp is like a miracle for me. Here are the attachments of my own notes for you who want to learn Responsive Web Design. TIA.
